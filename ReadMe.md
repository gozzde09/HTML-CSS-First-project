# State Website

This is my first project at the school.
The website is a mock state site where users can find information and book appointments through a simple e-application page. The idea is to gather everything in one place, similar to how citizens in Turkey use the e-stat platform for government services.

## Funktioner

- Three accessible pages with basic navigation.
- Working links:
  - **Logga in**
  - **Boka tid nu**
  - **Hemsidans logotyp**
- Some buttons are inactive and serve as visual elements only.

---

## Technology and Implementation

- HTML and CSS only – no frameworks, JavaScript, or external libraries (e.g., icons or APIs).
- Flexbox is used for layout.
- High-contrast color palette to meet WCAG AA standards.
- Validated with W3C services for both HTML and CSS (no errors or warnings).
- Responsive design:
 - Website and images adapt to different screen sizes.
 - Below 610px, images are hidden, inspired by how several government sites handle mobile views.
